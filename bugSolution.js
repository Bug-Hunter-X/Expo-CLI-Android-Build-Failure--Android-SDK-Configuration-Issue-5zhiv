The solution is to carefully check your Android SDK setup:

1. **Verify SDK Path:**  Ensure that the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variable is set correctly and points to the root directory of your Android SDK installation.
2. **Check SDK Manager:** Open the Android SDK Manager and install the necessary packages including build-tools and the Android NDK.
3. **Install missing components:**  The error message may indicate missing components like build tools or platform tools.  Install these components in the SDK Manager.
4. **Restart your system:** A simple restart often resolves issues related to environment variables.
5. **Clean and rebuild:** After making changes to your SDK configuration, run `expo prebuild` and try the build again.

If you are still facing issues, refer to Expo's documentation and troubleshooting guides for Android builds.
